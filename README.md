The users details are stored in a text file once registration is successful. While registering, user is
given the option to let the computer generate a password using random password
generator and is requested to give their phone number. A password strength checker has

entering their details. In case they forget their password, they will be receiving an OTP to
the phone number they registered with and once it is verified, they can update their
password.
